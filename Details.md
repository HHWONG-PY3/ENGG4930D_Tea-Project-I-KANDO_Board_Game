# Tea-Project-I-KANDO_Board_Game
I-KANDO is a program targeting children of ages of 11-13 in TEA Plantation Estate (Kandy). All of the following sections target the children to successfully change their behaviors to reduce health problems in the community.

I-KANDO is divided into four parts:
1. 3D Board Game
2. 7-week Challenge
3. Behavioral Changes
4. Sustainability

3D Board Game:

The objective of the 3D board game is to educate children on nutrition, specific diseases prevalent in Sri Lanka, hygiene and water issues, and smoking/drug/alcohol abuse problems. Individuals will have to do the board game for different levels.

7-Week Challenge:

The goal for the 7-week challenge is to enable individuals to reflect on what they have learned from the game and to provide insights for positive behavioral change. The 7-week challenge will be done simultaneously with the board game.

Behavioral Change:

During the 7-week challenge, individuals will also perform compulsory daily habits, including keeping personal hygiene, wearing masks constantly, and drinking clean water, and selective daily habits to change their behavior to become a healthy individual.

Sustainability:

Individuals may also become a leader. After finishing the prior steps, they will need five times to supervise with the senior leaders and create five questions (and get approval). They will receive a certificate and become a new leader to monitor others playing the game.
